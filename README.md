# predictive-model-construction

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for a predictive modeling assignment. The objective was to construct a predictive model that accurately estimates the target variable based on input features from a given dataset.

## Project Structure

- **`predictive_model.py`**: Python script for data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation.
- **`predictions.csv`**: CSV file containing the predicted target values for the test dataset.
- **`detailed_report.md`**: A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, model performance, and insights.
- **(Optional)** `final_model.pkl`: Serialized model file for future use (if applicable).

## Requirements
To run the code, you need the following Python packages:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `openpyxl` (for reading Excel files)

You can install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy openpyxl
